# Lithostratigraphic-Mapping-&-Structural-Analysis

# Project Overview

This repository presents the geological fieldwork conducted around Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh, India), focusing on the relationship between the Lameta Formation (Late Cretaceous) and the Deccan Traps, and the structural framework of the underlying Precambrian basement.
The study integrates lithostratigraphy, paleontology, and structural geology to reconstruct the geological evolution of the Narmada Rift Zone, one of India’s major tectonic lineaments.

The fieldwork covers key sites including:
Trishul Bhed, Chui Hills, Lamheta Ghat, Paat Baba Ridge, Bhedaghat, and Balancing Rock.

# Tools & Methodology

Field Equipment: 
1. Brunton Compass for structural measurements
2. Hand-held GPS for geolocation
3. Rock Hammer & Hand Lens for lithological analysis
4. Sample Bags for collection
5. Stereonets for plotting bedding, joints, and faults

Methods Used:
1. Structural Mapping: Measurement of strike, dip, fractures, joint sets, and fault orientations
2. Lithological Identification: Sandstone, limestone, basalt, granite, conglomerate, schist, phyllite
3. Stratigraphic Logging: Documented vertical succession at Lamheta Ghat and Chui Hills
4. Fossil Recording: Identification of dinosaur eggshell fragments and molluscan fossils
5. Geomorphological Analysis: Study of river incision, weathering, and erosional features (e.g., Balancing Rock, Marble Rocks gorge)

# Methodological Approach
1. Lithostratigraphic Logging:
    a. Measured vertical sections at Chui Hills and Lamheta Ghat
    b. Identified sedimentary structures like ripple marks, cross-bedding, mud cracks, calcrete nodules
    c. Classified lithologies: sandstone, shale, limestone, marl, conglomerate

3. Structural Mapping:
   a. Recorded faults, joints, shear zones, unconformities
   b. Constructed stereonet plots to determine dominant stress directions
   c. Identified extensional regimes, half-graben geometries, and conjugate fractures

3. Petrographic & Lithological Analysis:
    a. Granite: cooling joints, xenoliths, exfoliation
    b. Basalts: columnar jointing, vesicles, amygdales
    c. Limestones: fossiliferous textures, marls, nodular horizons

4. Paleontological Survey:
   a. Documented dinosaur nest structures, eggshell fragments
   b. Identified molluscan fossils, indicating aquatic deposition
   c. Correlated fossils to Cretaceous paleoecology

# Key Findings:

The field investigation across the Jabalpur Basin revealed a well-preserved and vertically continuous sequence that captures the transition from pre-volcanic sedimentation to extensive Deccan Trap lava emplacement. Detailed stratigraphic logging at Lamheta Ghat and Chui Hills showed that the Lameta Formation rests directly on an erosional surface carved into older Gondwana and Precambrian rocks, confirming the presence of a pronounced unconformity. The Lameta strata display a mixture of fluvial, lacustrine, and pedogenic signatures, including green sandstones, calcareous marls, mottled nodular beds, and fossil-bearing limestones, all of which point to a semi-arid floodplain environment during the Late Cretaceous. Overlying these sediments are thick basalt flows of the Deccan Traps, whose sharp contact with the Lameta beds marks the abrupt shift from a biologically rich terrestrial landscape to intense volcanic activity.

Paleontological observations significantly enhanced the reconstruction of this paleoenvironment. The identification of dinosaur eggshell fragments and nesting structures at Paat Baba Ridge provides compelling evidence that the Lameta floodplains supported active dinosaur breeding grounds shortly before the Deccan eruptions. These were accompanied by molluscan fossils embedded in laminated limestone, suggesting the presence of standing water bodies or shallow lakes that periodically developed across the landscape. Together, these fossil occurrences indicate that the region hosted a dynamic ecological system with both terrestrial and aquatic elements immediately prior to the volcanic transition.

Structural mapping further revealed that the geology of the region is heavily influenced by the Narmada–Son Lineament. Measurements taken at Trishul Bhed, Lamheta Ghat, and surrounding sites showed that the basin is dissected by a network of normal faults, half-graben geometries, and conjugate fracture systems, all pointing to long-standing extensional tectonics. These structures are not limited to sedimentary units; the granites exhibit shear zones and quartz veins, while the Deccan basalts display well-developed columnar jointing formed by cooling contraction. When plotted stereographically, these structures collectively demonstrate a dominant NW–SE extensional stress regime that has repeatedly shaped the region through multiple deformation phases. This structural framework, combined with the stratigraphic and paleontological evidence, paints a coherent picture of a tectonically active basin that transitioned rapidly from sediment accumulation to large-scale volcanism.

# Geological Significance:

The geological importance of the Jabalpur Basin lies in its ability to preserve a complete and uninterrupted record of several major Earth processes within a relatively compact geographic area. Nowhere else in central India is the transition from Precambrian basement rocks, through Gondwana sedimentation and Late Cretaceous paleoecosystems, up to the Deccan volcanic episode, expressed so clearly in the field. The Lameta Formation is particularly significant because it represents the last phase of sedimentation before the Deccan eruptions began. Its diverse facies and fossil evidence provide an intimate snapshot of environmental conditions leading up to the Cretaceous–Paleogene transition, a time associated globally with massive climatic disturbances and mass extinctions. The discovery of dinosaur nesting horizons and aquatic fossils within the Lameta beds suggests that this region was biologically vibrant immediately before volcanic activity reshaped the landscape.

Equally important is the basin’s position along the Narmada–Son Lineament—a major crustal fault system that has governed the tectonic evolution of central India for hundreds of millions of years. The presence of normal faults, tilted blocks, shear zones, and fracturing patterns makes the Jabalpur Basin a prime location for studying syn-rift sedimentation and post-rift deformation. These features demonstrate how the basin subsided, accumulated sediments, and later interacted with volcanic processes during the Deccan episode. Furthermore, the dramatic gorge at Bhedaghat, carved by the Narmada River through thick marble and basalt sequences, provides a modern example of how lithology, structure, and river incision interact to produce striking geomorphological landscapes.

Altogether, the stratigraphic continuity, fossil records, structural complexity, and volcanic-sedimentary interactions make the Jabalpur Basin a uniquely valuable natural archive for understanding India’s geological past. It serves not only as a key reference for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the Narmada Rift Zone but also as an important site for exploring the environmental conditions surrounding the end-Cretaceous period. The combination of these elements elevates the area to global geological relevance and underscores the scientific value of the fieldwork documented in this repository.
